# Overview

AWS provides you with the capabilities to track and maintain visibility into your AWS resources, configure and harden them according to custom and popular security standards such as CIS, detect vulnerabilities or deviation from state and automatically restore them to a secure state or apply patches.

In this workshop we start by guiding you through tagging your resources and maintaining an asset inventory for visibility and governance purposes with AWS Tags and Systems Manager (SSM). We then build an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) baking pipeline, harden the AMI with AWS SSM and install the Amazon Inspector agent. Within the pipeline we look for vulnerabilities and apply patches before promoting the AMI for use by an application.

Next we construct a continuous detection framework to detect change in state of security or detection of highly critical vulnerabilities using Amazon Inspector and AWS SSMâ€™s Patch Manager.

Finally we put all these pieces together to manage your Amazon EC2 Fleet at Scale.
